## Purpose

It's an easy way to send me URLs that I want to view on my device or in a browser on my PC.

For now, I use [URLCheck](https://github.com/TrianguloY/URLCheck) on my Android to share links, as it has support for webhooks.

## TO-DO:

- [ ] Support `files`
- [ ] Send `text/files`
- [ ] Add security
- [ ] Add Auth
  - [ ] Link with QR code
- [o] Linux notification
  - [x] Implement
  - [ ] Add action to notification?
